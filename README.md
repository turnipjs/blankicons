# Blank Icons
Simplistic phone icons meant to coordinate with the Blank Spaces ios launcher.

Use 0.png as the phone background to get the icons to blend in. 0.png is made specifically to make the bottom dock dissapear in dark mode.

Tell me what icons you would use by submitting an issue. I will get to them as soon as I can.
You can also submit a pull request, I will merge if I think it is good and fits the style. By submitting the pull request you surrender the rights to me.

If you like these icons feel free to Venmo or Paypal me with the sponsor links.
